## **A Note on Reading These**

Much of the 2026 agent literature is vendor content, and vendor content is directionally useful and quantitatively unreliable. Where this course cites a specific number — the 18-model context-rot study, effective context at 60–70% of nominal, the ~90% cache read discount — it comes from primary research or published API documentation. Where it cites an adoption or failure statistic (*"40% of multi-agent pilots fail within six months"*), treat it as an indication of direction rather than a measurement, and be suspicious of anyone quoting it to three significant figures.

The durable content of these sources is the **mechanisms**, not the figures. Context rot has a cause in transformer attention and training distribution; that will outlast any particular measurement of it.
