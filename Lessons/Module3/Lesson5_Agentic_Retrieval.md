# **Module 3, Lesson 5: Agentic Retrieval and the Limits of Vector RAG**

### Building on What We've Learned

You've built the full RAG pipeline: ingest, chunk, contextualize, embed, retrieve, generate. It's a genuinely powerful architecture and you should know it well.

This lesson is about its edges — because between 2025 and 2026 a large part of the industry discovered that for an important class of problems, a much simpler approach wins. Understanding *why* will make you better at choosing, which is the actual skill.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
*   **Describe** agentic retrieval and contrast it with the vector RAG pipeline.
*   **Explain** why agentic search outperforms vector RAG on code and filesystems.
*   **Choose** a retrieval strategy from the properties of your corpus and queries.
*   **Design** a hybrid system that uses both.

### **1. The Reversal**

Through 2024, "put a vector index on your codebase" was standard advice for AI coding tools. By 2026 the major coding agents had **removed** their vector indexes.

What replaced them is unglamorous: the agent uses the tools a competent engineer would use.

```
User: "Why does checkout fail for EU customers?"

  glob   "**/checkout*"                        → 4 files
  grep   "EU|region|vat"  src/checkout/        → 3 hits, 2 look relevant
  read   src/checkout/tax.py:40-90             → sees the VAT branch
  grep   "calculate_vat"  --type py            → finds 2 callers
  read   src/checkout/order.py:120-140         → sees the caller's assumption
  bash   pytest tests/test_checkout.py -k eu   → reproduces the failure
```

Comparative research found grep-based agentic search **generally more accurate than vector retrieval** across multiple agent harnesses — with the important caveat that the harness and tool-calling style mattered more than the retrieval algorithm itself (Module 8, Lesson 1).

**This did not generalize into "RAG is dead."** It generalized into something more useful: *vector similarity is one signal, and for some corpora it's the wrong one.*

---

### **2. Why Agentic Search Wins on Code**

Five reasons, and each one tells you something about when the reversal *doesn't* apply.

**A. Code has exact identifiers.**
When you need `calculateVAT`, you need `calculateVAT` — not "functions semantically similar to tax calculation." Vector search actively works against you here: it blurs the exact token you care about into a neighbourhood of related concepts.

**B. Code is a graph, and the graph is traversable.**
Imports, calls, and definitions are explicit links. An agent can follow `order.py` → `tax.py` → `rates.py` deterministically. Vector search has no notion of "and now the thing this thing calls" — it can only find things that *read* similarly, which is not the same as things that are *connected*.

**C. Chunking mutilates code.**
A function split across two chunks is two useless fragments. Code has structure that character-based chunking is blind to, and the structure is exactly what carries the meaning.

**D. The index is always stale.**
A codebase changes many times a day. A vector index reflects the last time you ran the embedding job; `grep` reflects the state of the file right now. For a fast-changing corpus, freshness beats sophistication — and staleness in a code index doesn't degrade gracefully, it produces confidently wrong answers about code that no longer exists.

**E. Verification is free.**
The agent can run the tests. That closes the loop in a way no retrieval score can: relevance stops being estimated and becomes checked.

### **3. The Real Trade-off**

| | Vector RAG | Agentic search |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Latency** | One fast query | Many sequential tool calls |
| **Token cost** | Low, predictable | High, variable — the exploration is in context |
| **Infrastructure** | Index, embeddings, sync pipeline | Almost none |
| **Freshness** | As of last index run | Always current |
| **Exact identifiers** | Poor | Excellent |
| **Fuzzy semantics** | Excellent | Poor — you must guess the right keyword |
| **Following relationships** | No | Yes |
| **Failure mode** | Silently retrieves the wrong chunk | Runs out of budget having found nothing |

The honest summary: **agentic search trades tokens and latency for accuracy and freshness.** It's more expensive per query and needs no infrastructure. Vector RAG is cheap and fast per query and needs a pipeline you must build, run, and keep in sync.

Note the last row especially. The failure modes are *different in kind*, and that difference should drive your choice as much as the accuracy numbers. Vector RAG fails **silently and plausibly** — it returns something, and the model answers from it. Agentic search fails **loudly** — the agent reports it couldn't find it. In domains where a confident wrong answer is worse than no answer, that asymmetry matters more than any benchmark.

### **4. Choosing: A Decision Guide**

Ask about your corpus and your queries.

```mermaid
graph TD
    accTitle: Retrieval strategy decision tree
    accDescr: Structured data leads to a direct query. Unstructured data with exact identifiers and explicit links leads to agentic search. Unstructured prose leads to keyword search if queries are literal, or by corpus size to either including the whole corpus or to hybrid RAG.
    A{"Is the data<br/>structured?"} -- yes --> SQL["<b>Query it.</b><br/>SQL / API — not retrieval"]
    A -- no --> B{"Does it have<br/>exact identifiers<br/>and explicit links?"}
    B -- "yes — code,<br/>configs, filesystems" --> AG["<b>Agentic search.</b><br/>glob · grep · read · follow"]
    B -- "no — prose,<br/>tickets, policies" --> C{"Do queries need<br/>fuzzy semantic<br/>matching?"}
    C -- yes --> D{"Corpus size?"}
    C -- no --> KW["<b>Keyword search.</b><br/>BM25 alone may be enough"]
    D -- "small: under ~50 docs" --> ALL["<b>Just include it.</b><br/>Retrieval is overhead"]
    D -- large --> RAG["<b>Hybrid RAG.</b><br/>vector + BM25 + rerank"]

    style AG fill:#ffe9cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style RAG fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style SQL fill:#e0e0e0,stroke:#333
    style ALL fill:#e0e0e0,stroke:#333
```

**Vector RAG remains the right answer for:** support tickets, policy documents, research literature, product documentation, chat transcripts, knowledge bases — large corpora of prose, queried in natural language, where the user's words won't match the document's words and the connections between documents are implicit.

**Agentic search is the right answer for:** codebases, configuration, filesystems, log files, structured document trees — anywhere identifiers are exact and relationships are explicit.

### **5. Combining Them**

The strongest systems use both, and route by query shape.

```python
def retrieve(query, corpus):
    # 1. Cheap, deterministic first pass: does the query contain an exact handle?
    if identifiers := extract_identifiers(query):        # SKU-123, ERR_X, func_name
        hits = keyword_search(identifiers, corpus)
        if hits:
            return hits                                  # done — no embedding needed

    # 2. Semantic pass for fuzzy questions.
    candidates = hybrid_search(query, corpus, k=50)
    ranked = rerank(query, candidates)[:5]

    # 3. Escalate to exploration only if the cheap paths came up empty or weak.
    if confidence(ranked) < THRESHOLD:
        return agentic_explore(query, corpus, budget=20_000)

    return ranked
```

Two design points worth stealing from this:

*   **Order by cost.** Try the cheap deterministic path first, then the cheap semantic path, and only spend an agentic exploration budget when both are weak. Most queries never reach step 3.
*   **Give retrieval an escape hatch.** `confidence(ranked) < THRESHOLD` is the retrieval-layer equivalent of the "I don't know" escape hatch you built into the generator in Lesson 4. A retrieval system that always returns its top five results, however bad, hands the generator garbage and asks it to be wise about it.

**The agentic-retrieval mindset, portable to any corpus:** stop thinking of retrieval as a *lookup* and start thinking of it as a *search process the agent conducts* — form a hypothesis, query, read, refine, query again. Vector search is one tool that process can use. Keyword search, metadata filters, and following explicit links are others. The agent decides.

### **Key Takeaways**

*   **Agentic search** — glob, grep, read, follow links, run the code — displaced vector RAG for code, and the harness mattered more than the algorithm.
*   It wins on code because of **exact identifiers, an explicit graph, chunking damage, index staleness, and free verification.** Where those don't hold, neither does the result.
*   The trade is **tokens and latency for accuracy and freshness** — and the failure modes differ in kind: vector RAG fails *silently*, agentic search fails *loudly*.
*   **Vector RAG remains correct** for large prose corpora with fuzzy queries and implicit relationships.
*   Combine them: **route by query shape, order by cost, and give retrieval an escape hatch** when confidence is low.

### **Hands-On Task: Choose and Combine**

**Part A — Route each system.** Choose vector RAG, agentic search, direct query, both, or none. Justify in two sentences, naming the corpus property that decided it.

1.  A support assistant over 80,000 historical Zendesk tickets.
2.  An agent that answers questions about your company's 2-million-line monorepo.
3.  A tool answering "which customers churned last quarter and what was their MRR?" over a data warehouse.
4.  An assistant over your team's 30-page engineering handbook.
5.  An agent that debugs production incidents using logs, traces, and the deploy history.
6.  A legal assistant over 15 years of contracts, where users ask things like "do any of our vendor agreements have unusual liability caps?"

**Part B — Design the router.** For system 5, write the routing logic. Which retrieval strategy handles which part, in what order, and what's the escalation condition between them?

**Part C — Cost the reversal.** Your team runs vector RAG over the monorepo: ~$400/month of infrastructure and a nightly re-index. A colleague proposes replacing it with agentic search — no infrastructure, but roughly 25,000 extra tokens per query at $5/1M input, over about 2,000 queries/month.

1.  Compute both monthly costs.
2.  Agentic search is more expensive here. Give the strongest argument for switching anyway — and be specific about which failure it eliminates.
3.  Name the one measurement you'd take *before* deciding, and say what result would change your recommendation.
