"""Structured note-taking: agent state that lives outside the context window.

Module 4, Lesson 3. The test for what belongs here is simple: **if losing it
would make the agent redo work or repeat a mistake, it goes in a file.**

Compaction is lossy by construction. Anything held only in the conversation can
be summarized away. Anything written here survives compaction, a crash, and a
process restart — which turns the context window into a cache over durable
storage, where cache loss is an inconvenience rather than a catastrophe.
