"""Cache-aware, budgeted context assembly.

This is the Context plane of Module 8, Lesson 4, made executable.

Two rules are enforced structurally rather than by convention:

1.  **Stable before volatile.** A prompt cache prefix is valid only up to the
    first byte that changed, so a volatile section placed above a stable one
    destroys the cache for everything below it. `assemble()` refuses to do this.

2.  **The budget is real.** When over budget, sections are dropped by *value*,
    not by age — the naive implementation truncates oldest-first, which is
    usually the user's original goal.
